# Pokemon Terminal Version

A pokemon mini game that's playable from right in the terminal. Encounter a random pokemon and try to catch it, adding it to your Pokedex. Gotta Catch 'Em All!

## NOTE
This is a very early version that is designed to be a more 'Proof of Concept'

### Upcoming Features
- Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
- Simulate battles between pokemon
- Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
- Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
- Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
- Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
- Random encounters with wild pokemon
- Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
